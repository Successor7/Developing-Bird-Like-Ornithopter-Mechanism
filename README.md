# Developing-Bird-Like-Ornithopter-Mechanism
The project "Developing and Optimizing a Bird-Like Ornithopter Mechanism" aims to design, build, and enhance a flying machine that mimics the flight mechanics of birds. Integrating principles from aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, biomechanics, robotics, control systems engineering, materials science, and aerodynamics, the project focuses on creating an efficient and functional ornithopter. Key objectives include replicating the flapping motion of bird wings, ensuring stable and controlled flight, and selecting lightweight, durable materials. By leveraging interdisciplinary knowledge, the project seeks to achieve an optimal design for a bird-like flying device.
